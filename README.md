SQL Data Cleaning Project â€“ Nashville Housing Dataset



Tools & Technologies: SQL Server, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation


1)Performed data cleaning and transformation on a real-world dataset to improve data quality and usability.


2)Standardized inconsistent date formats by converting raw SaleDate entries into a uniform Date type for accurate analysis.


3)Populated missing PropertyAddress values using self-joins and conditional updates, ensuring data completeness.



4)Split compound fields like PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress into separate columns (Address, City, State) for improved granularity and analysis.



5)Standardized categorical data in the SoldAsVacant column by replacing ambiguous "Y/N" values with "Yes/No."



6)Identified and removed duplicate records using a Common Table Expression (CTE) with ROW_NUMBER for efficient deduplication.


7)Optimized the dataset by removing unused columns to enhance storage efficiency and focus on relevant data.
